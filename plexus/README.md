```
cd digit-plexus
./plexus/install_plexus_venv.sh
```
This will handle the necessary dependencies and ensure your environment is ready for development.

## ðŸ›  Build ROS2 pkg
```
mkdir -p plexus_ws/src
cd plexus_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/facebookresearch/digit-plexus.git
cd ..
sh ./src/digit-plexus/plexus/ros2/plexus_pkg/colcon_build.sh
```
